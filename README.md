## Developer Guide:
We have some important advice for incoming developers. It is in the form of song
lyrics. We hope you enjoy it.


```
Verse 1:
We write code that's neat and clean
But if it's not well-documented
It can be a real bad scene

Chorus:
Code documentation, code readability
Good program design, they're all a necessity
Without them, our programs will surely fail
Suffering we will, without a code trail

Verse 2:
We may think our code is clear
But to others it may not appear
Without proper documentation
They'll be left in confusion

Chorus:
Code documentation, code readability
Good program design, they're all a necessity
Without them, our programs will surely fail
Suffering we will, without a code trail

Bridge:
Let's take the time to document our code
So others can easily understand
Let's strive for readability and design
And our programs will surely shine

Chorus:
Code documentation, code readability
Good program design, they're all a necessity
Without them, our programs will surely fail
Suffering we will, without a code trail.
```
